# Solving problems using coding
# Arrays overwiew

# An array data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that stores a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory. It allows for efficient access to elements using indices and is widely used in programming for organizing and manipulating data.

# Properties of Arrays
### Each array element is of the same data type and size. For example: For an array of integers with the int data type, each element of the array will occupy 4 bytes.
 # Elements of the array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
# Operations on Array in Python
# Below are some operations that can be performed in an array:

# .append()
# .insert()
# .pop()
# .remove()
# .index()
# .reverse()
